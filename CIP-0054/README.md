## Abstract

This document specifies a language for documenting Plutus contracts in a machine-readable manner. This is akin to what [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification) or [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.4.0) are for, documenting HTTP services and asynchronous services respectively. In a similar fashion, Plutus contracts have an interface which is mostly defined by its datums and redeemers structures. Plus, contracts evolving around state-machines can be represented as a serie of state transitions. This document is therefore a meta-specification fixing the vocabulary by which one can specify a Plutus contract interface.

## Motivation

While publicly accessible, on-chain contracts are currently inscrutable. Ideally, one would want to get an understanding of transactions surrounding certain script executions. This is both useful to visualize and control the evolution of a contract life-cycle; but also, as a user interacting with a contract, to ensure that I am authorizing a transaction to do what I intend to. Having a machine-readable specification in the form of a JSON-schema makes it easier (possible) to create a wide variety of use-cases around a single concise document, such as:

- Contract API Reference / Documentation
- Code generators for serialization/deserialization of Contract's elements
- Extra transaction validation layers 
- Better wallet UI / integration with DApps
- Automated Plutus-code scaffolding 

## Specification

To be written, for now, exploring what the result could look like. Ultimately, we want to top-level specification to be have its own meta-schema to disambiguate any doubt and allow validating blueprints automatically. 

Generally speaking, we also want the specification to match the following requirements:

- [x] 1. Must be machine-readable 

- [x] 2. Should be JSON/YAML based 

- [x] 3. Must provide ways of specifying **at least** datums and redeemers of a _"contract"_. These are ultimately Plutus 'Data', which are fully captured by the following types:
  - sum
  - list
  - map 
  - bytes
  - integer

  Those represent our primitive types and are used to construct any higher-level type definition.

- [x] 4. For state-machine based validators, should allow specifying the state transitions assuming that states are captured as datums and transitions as redeemers.

- [x] 5. Should come with few types builtins higher-level types to allow easily defining a contract's blueprint. 

    **TODO**: specify those types in a meta-schema in terms of data's primitives (constr, map, list, integer, bytes).

    > Few examples:
    > 
    > ```yaml
    > definitions:
    >   Unit:
    >     type: sum
    >     cases: {}
    > 
    >   Bool:
    >     type: sum
    >     cases:
    >       True: []
    >       False: []
    >
    >   Rational: 
    >     type: sum
    >     cases: 
    >       Rational:
    >         - type: integer
    >         - type: integer
    > ```

- [x] 6. Should have keywords to combine smaller types together. We'll borrow `oneOf` from JSON-schema, and add some more as first-class citizens:
    - oneOf 
    - maybe
    - either
    - these 

## Rationale

To be written.

## Backward Compatibility

N/A

## Path to active

- [ ] Few major DApps adopting the schema and specifying their contracts with it.
- [ ] Explorer / Wallets leveraging the format to display enhanced information for transactions carrying Plutus scripts.
- [ ] A command-line tool for validating plutus-blueprint definitions (based on a meta-schema)

## Example


```yaml
plutus-blueprint: 1.0.0

$schema: _ # URI to the meta-schema for plutus-blueprint, once it exists.
